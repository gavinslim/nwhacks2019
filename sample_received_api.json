/*
    By making multiple method calls to the data service that we have,
    we will aggregate that data and return json which will count the
    number of people with each attribute.

    The new service shall allow for filters. Most filters will have array values.
    Attributes that match the value present in the array should be included in the
    response. Absense of a filter should default to including all values.

    For example, I hit the URL with following params:
        1)  gender: male.
                >>> All values with gender === male should be counted.
        2)  reaction: ['positive', 'neutral']
                >>> All values with reaction === 'positive' OR reaction === 'neutral' should be included.
                    Values with reaction === 'negative' should be discarded from the response.
